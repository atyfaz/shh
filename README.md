# SHH (WIP)
Shortcut Helper (SHH) is an ease of access software to make navigating your computer more efficient and organized, that also has game library and worldbuilding database functions.

This program is being made due to a personal desire I have to maximize my efficiency and organization at everything I do, and keep track of details, files, and programs in ways better than Windows' native file explorer.

As such, I am a gamer and an artist who builds massive worlds for their stories, comics, and games. Thats why I'm programming a game library and worldbuilding database into it to suit my needs, though others could get use out of maybe just one or two of its main functions individually. I hope anyone who tries the finished product finds it helpful. :>

# INSTALLATION
For people only interested in downloading and using the program, you will only need the installer.
Otherwise, I'm supplying all the scripts, sprites, and files used in the making of this software.

I will also be supplying tutorials and guides in both text and video formats for this program's use once it is finished, and those will be linked here.

I'll keep anyone following this posted!
